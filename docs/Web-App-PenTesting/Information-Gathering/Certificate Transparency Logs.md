- SSL/TLS encrypts commz between a browser and a website
- It uses a digital certificate to verify the websites identity and then allows commz
- Attackers can exploit rogue or misissued certs to impersonate websites, intercept sensitive data, spread malware
- CT Logs are important in this case
<br>
### CT Logs:
- public append-only ledgers that record the issuance of SSL/TLS certs
- When a CA (Cert Authority) issues a new certificate, it is sent to multiple CT Logs which are maintained by independent organizations and can be inspected by anyone.
- `Global Registry of Certs`
1. `Early Detection of Rogue Certificates`
2. `Accountability for Certificate Authorities`
3. `Strengthening the Web PKI`

### Web Recon:
- CT Logs for subdomain enum are better than wordlist brute-forcing as they can provide a complete list of the domains and subdomains issued.
- They can also unveil subdomains associated with old or expired certs. These might have old software and vulns that can be exploited.

### Tools:
- `crt.sh`
- `censys`
<br>
- `curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=facebook.com&output=json" | jq -r '.[] | select(.name_value | contains("dev")) | .name_value' | sort -u`
