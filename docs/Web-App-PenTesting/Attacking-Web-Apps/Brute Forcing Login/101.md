## MATH
- `Possible Combinations = Character Set Size (power) Password Length`

	- With increase in length, or character set size, the complexity increases multifolds

## Hybrid Attacks:
- org requires user to change password frequently
- this change could have patterns

- If we know a password policy, we can create a targeted wordlist from a huge wordlist:
	- eg: we know the policy - min length: 8 chars, has 1 upper, lower, number
- STEP 1:
	- `grep -E '^.{8,}$' darkweb2017-top10000.txt > darkweb2017-minlength.txt`
		- minimum length: 8 chars
- STEP 2:
	- `grep -E '[A-Z]' darkweb2017-minlength.txt > darkweb2017-uppercase.txt`
- STEP 3:
	- `grep -E '[a-z]' darkweb2017-uppercase.txt > darkweb2017-lowercase.txt`
- STEP 4: 
	- `grep -E '[0-9]' darkweb2017-lowercase.txt > darkweb2017-number.txt`
- This is like chaining the biggest file and keep filtering until we get all the requirements as per the policy
