## Stored
- Persistent
- if our payload is stored on the backend and is displayed everytime we visit a page, this can affect any user that visits the page.
- this is most critical as it can affect the max number of users.

- Use `<plaintext>` or `<script>print()</script>` as alternate payloads

<hr>

## Reflected
- non-persistent
- `Reflected XSS` vulnerabilities occur when our input reaches the back-end server and gets returned to us without being filtered or sanitized.
- temporary messages, once we move from the page, they aren't executed again.
