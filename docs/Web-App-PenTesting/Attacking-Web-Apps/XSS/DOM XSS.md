- Document Object Model
- every HTML page is a document
- this is a non-persistent type called DOM-based XSS.
- Other 2 types send the data to the backend servers.
- DOM XSS is completely processed on the client side through JavaScript.
- DOM XSS occurs when JS is used to change the page source through the DOM.
#### Example:
- When we send the user input in a text-input field the user input is reflected on the page.

- In other 2 cases, there is a request being sent to the backend server when a user-input is entered.

### Source & Sink
- The `Source` is the JavaScript object that takes the user input, and it can be any input parameter like a URL parameter or an input field, as we saw above.
- the `Sink` is the function that writes the user input to a DOM Object on the page.
	- If the `Sink` function does not properly sanitize the user input, it would be vulnerable to an XSS attack. 
	- Common JavaScript functions to write to DOM objects are:
		- `document.write()`
		- `DOM.innerHTML`
		- `DOM.outerHTML`
	- some of the `jQuery` library functions that write to DOM objects are:
		- `add()`
		- `after()`
		- `append()`
- `DOM.innerHTML` does not allow the `<script>` tag.
- `<img src="" onerror=alert(window.origin)>` - use this payload
- once executed, send the same URL to the victim.
