- `--parse-errors` use this to parse any dbms errors as the program runs
- `-t` switch will store the traffic to some output file
- `-v 6` - set verbosity level
- `--proxy 127.0.0.1:8080` to proxy the complete traffic through burp

## Attack Tuning
- Every payload has a vector and a boundary
	- eg PAYLOAD: `IN' UNION ALL SELECT 1,2,VERSION()-- -`
	- `IN' UNION ALL SELECT 1,2,VERSION()` --- this is the vector
	- `-- -` --- this is the boundary
### Prefix suffix
- in some cases, we might need to have a prefix or a suffix with the vector
- `sqlmap -u "www.example.com/?q=test" --prefix="%'))" --suffix="-- -"`

### Level/Risk
- ![](/attachments/Pasted-image-20250629171337.png)
- we usually dont need to change these settings
- usually Login pages require higher risk and level as `OR` payloads are involved

## Advanced Tuning
### Status codes
- `--code=200` means that a 200 response should be considered as TRUE.
	- this is helpful when the target responds with a lot of TRUE FALSE and 200, 400, 500 response codes
### Titles
-  difference in response can be seen using the HTTP page titles.
- `--titles <title>` can be used to instruct the detection mechanism to base the comparison based on the content of the HTML tag `<title>`   
### Strings
-  In case when the page responds with a specific string value `SUCCESS` only when the response is `TRUE`, `--string=SUCCESS` can be used.
### Text-only
- When dealing with a lot of hidden content, such as certain HTML page behaviors tags (e.g. `<script>`, `<style>`, `<meta>`, etc.), we can use the `--text-only` switch, which removes all the HTML tags, and bases the comparison only on the textual (i.e., visible) content.
### Techniques
- if we want to skip the time-based blind and stacking SQLi payloads and only test for the boolean-based blind, error-based, and UNION-query payloads, we can specify these techniques with `--technique=BEU`.
