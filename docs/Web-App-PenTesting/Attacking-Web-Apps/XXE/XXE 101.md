- `Extensible Markup Language (XML)` is a common markup language (similar to HTML and SGML) designed for flexible transfer and storage of data and documents in various types of applications. 
- XML is not focused on displaying data but mostly on storing documents' data and representing data structures. 
- XML documents are formed of element trees, where each element is essentially denoted by a `tag`, and the first element is called the `root element`, while other elements are `child elements`.
