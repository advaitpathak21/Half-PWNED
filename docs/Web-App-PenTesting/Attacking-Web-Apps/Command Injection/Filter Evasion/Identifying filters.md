### Filter/WAF Detection
- If we try our payload and see an error on the same page means that the application has filters in place
	- if we saw another page with a `REQUEST-ID`, we can say that the WAF blocked it.
- **BREAKDOWN**
- Payload: `127.0.0.1; whoami`
	- the filter either detected a blacklisted `character` or a `command` or `both`
### Blacklisted Characters
- eg code:
	- ![](/attachments/Pasted-image-20250809094348.png)
- if any char in our input string matches, our request is denied.
- we can use `<<<` instead of `|`
#### Before we start the attempts to bypass a filter, we should try to find the character that is being filtered.

### Identifying the Blacklisted character
- Reduce the string to find where the error starts.
