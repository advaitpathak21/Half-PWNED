## Injecting
- check for front end validation
- bypass it using burp suite
- eg: `127.0.0.1; whoami`

<hr>

## Other operators
- AND: `&&` - this will execute both the commands. 
	- dont forget to encode while sending the request
- OR: `||` this will see if either 1 command is executed
	- if the first command is executed, it wont execute the second command.
- Newline: `%0d%0a` - use `Enter` on keyboard in Burp
