- Change the HTTP Verb.
- you can check the allowed http methods using `OPTION`
- Then, can try one of the methods to check if it responds differently.
- This is due to `Insecure COnfig`
<br>
**IMPORTANT**
- Change `POST` request to a `GET` request with those parameters

<hr>

## Bypass Filters
- give input and press 'Enter'
- check that the file is created
- give input for command injection - `test;`
	- notice that the app responds with `malicious request detected.`
- It can be that the security filter is only applied for a specific http method.
- changing the http method, the app fulfills the request.
- Now, we can do command injection by changing the GET request to a POST request.
- This is due to `Insecure Coding`

<hr>

## Prevention
- most modern web servers, including `Apache`, `Tomcat`, and `ASP.NET` have this.
### Insecure Config
- the Apache's site configuration file is present in (e.g. `000-default.conf`), or in a `.htaccess` web page configuration file

- For `ASP.NET`
