- LFI + automated scanning to find folders/files, payloads
- Basic bypasses
- PHP filters to get base64 data
- PHP wrappers for remote code execution
- RFI using http, ftp, smb
- LFI if we can upload a file
- Log poisoning if there is a PHP session id, or apache/nginx

<hr>

Assessment:
- `page` parameter was returning base64 encoded value of the `index/contact/about` pages.
- `index` page had a php code that wasnt visible in normal source code.
	- this had a link to an `ilf_admin/index.php` page
- the admin page had a `log` parameter that was LFI injectable.
	- found `/../../../../../etc/passwd`
- since `nginx` server, we got the `access.log` for nginx at `/var/log/nginx/access.log`
- tried log poisoning by modifying the `User-Agent` header and that was possible.
- Added the php webshell to the `User-Agent` and sent the request.
- Now, in the first try of accessing the logs, enter the `&cmd=id` part to not mess the log file.
- now, we have RCE.
