- Local File Inclusion
- Two common readable files that are available on most back-end servers are `/etc/passwd` on Linux and `C:\Windows\boot.ini` on Windows.
**IMPORTANT**
- In a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability exploit targeting a PHP file (like `index.php`), **the PHP code within the file will generally be executed by the web server, resulting in the rendered output (often HTML) being returned to the attacker, rather than the raw source code itself**.

### Path Traversal
- the **absolute path** `/etc/passwd` will work if the user input is directly used by the application.
- however, if the userinput is only used within a directory, as a filename, then we would not get the expected output.

- to bypass this restriction of **relative paths**, we can use `../`

### Filename Prefix
- in case when the user-input is being appended with a filename prefix:
	- ![](/attachments/Pasted-image-20250705181706.png)
	- if we enter `../etc/passwd`, it will be read as `lang_../etc/passwd` which will not be found.
- We can enter `/../etc/passwd` in this case.
	- it will be read as `lang_/../etc/passwd`

### Appended Extensions
- ![](/attachments/Pasted-image-20250705184219.png)
	- if we enter `/etc/passwd`, it will be rendered as `/etc/passwd.php`
