- automation server to build and test projects continuously
- written in java (Jenkins was previously called Hudson)
- it runs in servlet containers like Tomcat
## Discovery
- for an Internal pentest: we've completed our web discovery and find what we believe is a Jenkins instance.
- usually running on Windows servers as the all-powerful `SYSTEM` account.
- If we gain access via Jenkins and gain remote code execution as the `SYSTEM` account, we would have a foothold in AD to begin enumeration of the domain environment.
- **Jenkins runs on Tomcat port 8080 by default.**
- uses port 5000 for slave servers - used for commz between a master and a slave
- Jenkins can use a local database, LDAP, Unix user database, delegate security to a servlet container, or use no authentication at all. Administrators can also allow or disallow users from creating accounts.
## Enum
