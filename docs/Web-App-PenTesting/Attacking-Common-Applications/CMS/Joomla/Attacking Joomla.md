**Note:**
use non-standard file names and parameters for our web shells to not make them easily accessible to a "drive-by" attacker during the assessment. 
	We can also password protect and even limit access down to our source IP address. 
Also, we must always remember to clean up web shells as soon as we are done with them but still include the file name, file hash, and location in our final report to the client.
- add the `system()` GET php shell with an unusual parameter name to the `error.php` file.
- call the file:
	- `http://dev.inlanefreight.local/templates/beez3/error.php?hardwell=cat+../../flag_6470e394cbf6dab6a91682cc8585059b.txt`
