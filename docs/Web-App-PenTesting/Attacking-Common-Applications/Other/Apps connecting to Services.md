- apps connecting to services can often include connection strings that can be leaked if they are not secured
## ELF Executable Examination
- an `octopus_checker` binary is found on a pentest
- running the application locally reveals that it connects to a db instance to check the dbs availability.
- if it trys to connect to a db, it might have some string that has creds
- using https://github.com/longld/peda tools to debug
- using https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg & https://pwndbg.re/pwndbg/latest/commands/

## DLL File Examination
- DLL file is a `Dynamically Linked Library` - it contains code that is called from other programs while they are running
- a dll file is found during a pentest
- `Get-FileMetaData .\MultimasterAPI.dll`
	- says this is `.NET` assembly
- Using the debugger and .NET assembly editor [dnSpy](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy) to see the source code directly
- This tool allows reading, editing, and debugging the source code of a .NET assembly (C# and Visual Basic).
