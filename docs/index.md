!!! quote "The Philosophy of a Seeker"
    To stay **Half-PWNED** is to remain like a student.

Welcome to my central repository for security research and machine writeups. This site is divided into core `technical playbooks` and a `blog` of some HackTheBox labs I've pwned, my projects.

### Check my website out - [here](https://website.advaitpathak.com).

## 🚩 HackTheBox Blog (WIP):

My writeups are my notes, and are intentionally concise. If you are following along, stop and ask: Why did we choose this port? What did that error message actually imply? My goal is to develop the "WHY?..." and not just copy-paste.

This documentation is generated as I progress through various certifications and platforms.

Tools Used: Nmap, BurpSuite, Metasploit, Impacket, and custom Python scripts.

Goal: To document the transition from enumeration to exploitation without losing the "thread" of logic.
