## DNS
- `host` files are used for IP and domain mapping
- This is a local file that can override the internet dns mapping
- The hosts file is located in:
	- `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on `Windows`
	- `/etc/hosts` on `Linux and MacOS.`
- ***Block unwanted sites by mapping them to incorrect IPs.***
