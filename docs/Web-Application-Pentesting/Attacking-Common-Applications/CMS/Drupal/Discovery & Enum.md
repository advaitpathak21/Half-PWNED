- Drupal supports three types of users by default:
	1. `Administrator`: This user has complete control over the Drupal website.
	2. `Authenticated User`: These users can log in to the website and perform operations such as adding and editing articles based on their permissions.
	3. `Anonymous`: All website visitors are designated as anonymous. By default, these users are only allowed to read posts.
