# PT Steps
- Thick client applications are complex than others, the attack surface can be large. 
- Thick client application penetration testing can be done using automated tools and manually. The following steps are usually followed when testing thick client applications.
## Info Gathering
- id the app infrastructure, prog languages, frameworks, infrastructure.
- id technologies on client/server side, entry points & user inputs.
- tools:

### Client-side
- processing done on client side but commz with service is done
- Sensitive information like usernames and passwords, tokens, or strings for communication with other services, might be stored in the application's local files.
- hardcoded creds in app source code
- static and dynamic analysis

### Network Side Attacks
- application is communicating with a local or remote server, network traffic analysis will help us capture sensitive information that might be transferred through HTTP/HTTPS or TCP/UDP connection, and give us a better understanding of how that application is working.

### Server Side Attacks
- 
## Retrieving hardcoded Credentials from Thick-Client Applications
- scenario walks us through enum and exploitation of a thick client app to move laterally inside a corporate network.
<br>
- we have gained access to an SMB server.
- in a share, we see a binary - `.\RestartOracle-Service.exe`
- download it locally and run it. we see no output (nothing ran or something runs hidden)
