### System commands
- avoid executing system commands and use the in-built functions of the back-end language.
	- there are secure implementations in PHP (`fsockopen` for `os.ping`)
- validate and sanitize the user input on the back-end before using in system commands
### Input validation
- `input validation should be done both on the front-end and on the back-end`.
- ensure it matches the expected format for the input, such that the request is denied if it does not match
### Input Sanitization
```php
$ip = preg_replace('/[^A-Za-z0-9.]/', '', $_GET['ip']);
```
- replace chars by empty chars
