- use the flaw in user input sanitization to `write` JavaScript code to the page and execute it on the client side.

- A basic example of an XSS attack is having the target user unwittingly send their session cookie to the attacker's web server. Another example is having the target's browser execute API calls that lead to a malicious action, like changing the user's password to a password of the attacker's choosing. There are many other types of XSS attacks, from Bitcoin mining to displaying ads.
- As XSS attacks execute JavaScript code within the browser, they are limited to the browser's JS engine (i.e., V8 in Chrome). They cannot execute system-wide JavaScript code to do something like system-level code execution. In modern browsers, they are also limited to the same domain of the vulnerable website. Nevertheless, being able to execute JavaScript in a user's browser may still lead to a wide variety of attacks, as mentioned above. In addition to this, if a skilled researcher identifies a binary vulnerability in a web browser (e.g., a Heap overflow in Chrome), they can utilize an XSS vulnerability to execute a JavaScript exploit on the target's browser, which eventually breaks out of the browser's sandbox and executes code on the user's machine.

- In 2014, a security researcher accidentally identified an [XSS vulnerability](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/06/serious-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-tweetdeck-twitter.html) in Twitter's TweetDeck dashboard. This vulnerability was exploited to create a [self-retweeting tweet](https://twitter.com/derGeruhn/status/476764918763749376) in Twitter, which led the tweet to be retweeted more than 38,000 times in under two minutes. Eventually, it forced Twitter to [temporarily shut down TweetDeck](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/11/twitter-tweetdeck-xss-flaw-users-vulnerable) while they patched the vulnerability.
- To this day, even the most prominent web applications have XSS vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Even Google's search engine page had multiple XSS vulnerabilities in its search bar, the most recent of which was in [2019](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/web-security-zone/mutation-xss-in-google-search/) when an XSS vulnerability was found in the XML library. Furthermore, the Apache Server, the most commonly used web server on the internet, once reported an [XSS Vulnerability](https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/apache_org_04_09_2010) that was being actively exploited to steal user passwords of certain companies. All of this tells us that XSS vulnerabilities should be taken seriously, and a good amount of effort should be put towards detecting and preventing them.

| Type                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Stored (Persistent) XSS`        | The most critical type of XSS, which occurs when user input is stored on the back-end database and then displayed upon retrieval (e.g., posts or comments)                                                                                   |
| `Reflected (Non-Persistent) XSS` | Occurs when user input is displayed on the page after being processed by the backend server, but without being stored (e.g., search result or error message)                                                                                 |
| `DOM-based XSS`                  | Another Non-Persistent XSS type that occurs when user input is directly shown in the browser and is completely processed on the client-side, without reaching the back-end server (e.g., through client-side HTTP parameters or anchor tags) |
