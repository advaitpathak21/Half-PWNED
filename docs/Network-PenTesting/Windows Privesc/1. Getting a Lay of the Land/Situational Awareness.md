## Network Information
- Gathering Network information is important
- we can find that a host is **dual-homed** and that may allow us to move laterally into another part of the network that we could not access previously.
- always look at **routing tables** to view information about the local network and networks around it
- view the **ARP cache** for each interface and view other hosts the host has recently communicated with.
#### COMMANDS
- **Get Interface, ip, dns info**
	- `ipconfig /all`
- **ARP Table**
	- `arp -a`
- **Routing Table**
	- `route print`

## Enumerating Protections
- modern envs will have some AV, EDR service to monitor, alert on and block threats.
- these tools can interfere with the enumeration process
- if using public PoCs, these can be blocked.
- Hence, we enumerate protections and craft custom payloads or modify tools before compiling them
