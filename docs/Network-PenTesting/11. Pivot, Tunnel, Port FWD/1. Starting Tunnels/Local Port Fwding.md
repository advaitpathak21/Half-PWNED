## SSH Local Port FWDing
### Scenario
- Your PWNBox has a connection to an Ubuntu server
- The ubuntu server has a MySQL port `3306` open on its localhost and not to the public.
- We can forward our local port `1234` to remote port `3306` to access Ubuntu's MySQL listener on its localhost interface.

- SSH can listen on our local host and forward a service on the remote host to our port.
- **Redirect a `local port` to a port on the `remote host` through SSH.**
- Access remote services on our local host.

### Workflow:
- **forward our local port (1234) over SSH to the Ubuntu server.**
	- `ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 ubuntu@10.129.203.10`
		- `-L` : tell the SSH client to request the SSH server to forward all the data we send via port 1234 to localhost:3306 on the Ubuntu server
	- Now, we will be able to access `MySQL` on 1234 locally on the PWNBox
- **Confirm port forwarding:**
	- `netstat -tanp | grep 1234`
	- `netstat -tunlp | grep 1234`
	- `nmap -v -sV -p1234 localhost`
- **Forwarding multiple ports locally**
	- `ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 -L 8080:localhost:80 ubuntu@10.129.202.64`
