# Service Misconfig

### Authentication

* default creds/weak passwords
* Anonymous Login
* Misconfigured access (incorrect permissions)
  * RBAC, ACL - https://authress.io/knowledge-base/role-based-access-control-rbac

### Unnecessary Defaults

* New software might ask for a new password but the rest of the settings might still be default
