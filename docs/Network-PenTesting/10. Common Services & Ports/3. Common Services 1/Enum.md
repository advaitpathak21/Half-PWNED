* This is for external PenTests and not internal (Active Directory)

**When the PenTest starts:**

1. Layer 1: Internet Presence
   * `The goal of this layer is to identify all possible target systems and interfaces that can be tested.`
2. Layer 2: Gateway
   * `The goal is to understand the interface of the reachable target, how it is protected, and where it is located in the network.`
3. Layer 3: Accessible Services
   * `This layer aims to understand the reason and functionality of the target system and gain the necessary knowledge to communicate with it and exploit it for our purposes effectively.`
4. Layer 4: Processes
   * `The goal here is to understand the functionalities working and identify the dependencies between them.`
5. Layer 5: Privilege
   * `It is crucial to identify these and understand what is and is not possible with these privileges.`
6. Layer 6: OS Setup
   * `The goal here is to see how the administrators manage the systems and what sensitive internal information we can glean from them.`
