# Infrastructure Enum

#### Domain Information

* Work on the main website to find our tech stack and services
* If we discover a service that we do not know how it works:
  * we must try to understand its fx and opportunities.
  * It also gives us an overview of the company's structure.
* Think of being a dev and you'll have more technical insights\

* First thing to check might be the SSL Certificate information: https://crt.sh/
* Get JSON Output:
  * `curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq .`
* Filter Unique Subdomains:
  * `curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq . | grep name | cut -d":" -f2 | grep -v "CN=" | cut -d'"' -f2 | awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n");}1;' | sort -u`
* Checking Hosts: - `for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f1,4;done`
* Once we know what IPs we wanna investigate further, we use Shodan on that list
* SHODAN finds devices and systems connected to the internet
  * `for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f4 >> ip-addresses.txt;done`
  * `for i in $(cat ip-addresses.txt);do shodan host $i;done`\

* Find available DNS records: `dig any inlanefreight.com`

#### Cloud Resources:

* `intext: <target> inurl:<s3/blob/cloudstorage>`
* Check in source code links
* `domain.glass`
* `greyhat warfare`
* `LinkedIn` or `Xing`
* `GitHub`
