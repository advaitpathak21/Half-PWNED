- PATH - http://www.linfo.org/path_env_var.html
	- contains absolute path
- the PATH env variable specifies the set of directories where an executable can be located.
#### Checking PATH details
- `echo $PATH` **OR** `env | grep PATH`
<br>
- creating a script in the path directory will make it executable from anywhere
- if we have can modify the PATH, we can replace a simple binary like `ls` with a reverse shell. 
```shell-session
touch ls
echo 'echo "PATH ABUSE!!"' > ls
chmod +x ls
```
- if we add our current directory that contains our scripts to the path, then we can call our binaries/scripts from anywhere.
```shell-session
PATH=.:${PATH}
export PATH
echo $PATH
```
