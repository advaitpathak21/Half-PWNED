-  [CVE-2017-12542](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/you-can-bypass-authentication-on-hpe-ilo4-servers-with-29-a-characters/) with HP iLO (Integrated Lights Out) Management devices. Just sending 29 characters in an HTTP Header parameter caused a buffer overflow which bypassed login.
- sometimes - no need for an actual payload that you'll read more about later since the system "failed open" upon reaching an error.
- usually seen on `c` or `c++` as these are performance based and require the user to do the memory management which bring in security issues.
- `Java` has `garbage collection` and does memory management

## Exploit Dev intro
- The Exploitation Phase goal is to use the information found and its analysis to exploit the potential ways to gain interaction and/or access to the target system.
- Such exploit codes often serve as `proof-of-concept` (`POC`) in our reports.
- 2 types:
	- 0-day (unknown codes)
	- N-day (known codes)

## CPU Architecture
- The architecture of the `Von-Neumann` was developed by the Hungarian mathematician John von Neumann, and it consists of four functional units:
	- `Memory`
	- `Control Unit`
	- `Arithmetical Logical Unit`
	- `Input/Output Unit`

- Each `CPU` has an architecture on which it was built. The best-known `CPU architectures` are:
	- `x86`/`i386` - (AMD & Intel)
	- `x86-64`/`amd64` - (Microsoft & Sun)
	- `ARM` - (Acorn)
