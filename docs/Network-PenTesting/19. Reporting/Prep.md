### Components of a report
- Prioritize attack vectors
- write attack chains
	- also detailed str for the attack chains
- write a strong executive summary
	- 
### Important Sections
- `Attack Path` - An outline of the entire path if you gain a foothold during an external penetration test or compromise one or more hosts (or the AD domain) during an internal penetration test. Outline the path as closely as possible using screenshots and command output will make it easier to paste into the report later and only need to worry about formatting.
- `Credentials` - A centralized place to keep your compromised credentials and secrets as you go along.
-  `Findings` - We recommend creating a subfolder for each finding and then writing our narrative and saving it in the folder along with any evidence (screenshots, command output). It is also worth keeping a section in your notetaking tool for recording findings information to help organize them for the report.
- `Vulnerability Scan Research` - A section to take notes on things you've researched and tried with your vulnerability scans (so you don't end up redoing work you already did).
- `Service Enumeration Research` - A section to take notes on which services you've investigated, failed exploitation attempts, promising vulnerabilities/misconfigurations, etc.
- `Web Application Research` - A section to note down interesting web applications found through various methods, such as subdomain brute-forcing. It's always good to perform thorough subdomain enumeration externally, scan for common web ports on internal assessments, and run a tool such as Aquatone or EyeWitness to screenshot all applications. As you review the screenshot report, note down applications of interest, common/default credential pairs you tried, etc.
- `AD Enumeration Research` - A section for showing, step-by-step, what Active Directory enumeration you've already performed. Note down any areas of interest you need to run down later in the assessment.
- `OSINT` - A section to keep track of interesting information you've collected via OSINT, if applicable to the engagement.
- `Administrative Information` - Some people may find it helpful to have a centralized location to store contact information for other project stakeholders like Project Managers (PMs) or client Points of Contact (POCs), unique objectives/flags defined in the Rules of Engagement (RoE), and other items that you find yourself often referencing throughout the project. It can also be used as a running to-do list. As ideas pop up for testing that you need to perform or want to try but don't have time for, be diligent about writing them down here so you can come back to them later.
- `Scoping Information` - Here, we can store information about in-scope IP addresses/CIDR ranges, web application URLs, and any credentials for web applications, VPN, or AD provided by the client. It could also include anything else pertinent to the scope of the assessment so we don't have to keep re-opening scope information and ensure that we don't stray from the scope of the assessment.
- `Activity Log` - High-level tracking of everything you did during the assessment for possible event correlation.
- `Payload Log` - Similar to the activity log, tracking the payloads you're using (and a file hash for anything uploaded and the upload location) in a client environment is critical. More on this later.

- **The main difference in our lab is that we will not include OSINT data/publicly available information such as email addresses, subdomains, credentials in breach dumps, domain registration/ownership data, etc., because we are not testing against an actual company with an internet presence.**
- If any of these situations occur, you should expect more scrutiny around severity levels and perhaps pressure to modify things that should not be modified to help them out. In these situations, your response should be carefully crafted to be both clear that you’re not going to cross ethical boundaries (but be careful about insinuating that they’re asking you to do something intentionally dishonest, indicating that they are dishonest), but also commiserate with their situation and offer some ways out of it for them. For example, if their concern is being on the hook with an auditor to fix something in an amount of time that they don’t have, they may be unaware that many auditors will accept a thoroughly documented remediation plan with a reasonable deadline on it (and justification for why it cannot be completed more quickly) instead of remediating and closing the finding within the examination period. This allows you to keep your integrity intact, fosters the feeling with the client that you sincerely care about their plight, and gives them a path forward without having to turn themselves inside out to make it happen.
