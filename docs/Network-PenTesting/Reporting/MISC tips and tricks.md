### Communication
- At the start of every engagement, we should send a `start notification` email including information such as:
	- Tester name
	- Description of the type/scope of the engagement
	- Source IP address for testing (public IP for an external attack host or the internal IP of our attack host if we are performing an Internal Penetration Test)
	- Dates anticipate for testing
	- Primary and secondary contact information (email and phone)
- At the end of each day, we should send a stop notification to signal the end of testing. This can be a good time to give a high-level summary of findings
