- 
- use CPTS template
- when a trigger is reached, work on the report
	- host or service discovered
	- virtual host/subdomain discovered
	- finding discovered
	- got foothold
	- got root
	- compromised a user
	- captured a flag
- **Assessment Overview and Recommendations**
	- like AWS section (the low-severity findings revolved around)
	- 2 line problem, 1 line remediation.
	- new para for every finding
	- mention positives
- check **Short Term**, **Medium Term**, and **Long Term** remediation fields
- An appendix not included in the SysReptor template but recommended by the course material is **Domain Password Review**.
	- In this appendix, you’ll provide statistics on the passwords of Active Directory domain users after achieving domain compromise and dumping `NTDS.dit`. Key statistics to include are:
		- Number of hashes obtained
		- Number of unique hashes
		- Percentage of hashes cracked
		- Most commonly used passwords
		- Password length breakdown
	- To generate these statistics, I recommend using the [DPAT](https://github.com/clr2of8/DPAT) Python script. Take the most insightful statistics it provides and create tables for them in the appendix.

## FINDINGS
- dont keep images/screenshots.
	- if ST wants to recreate, they'll want the whole input instead of copy from screenshots.
