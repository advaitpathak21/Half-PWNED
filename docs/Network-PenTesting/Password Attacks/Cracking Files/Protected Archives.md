## Cracking Archives
### Zip
- common in Windows
- `zip2john`

### gzip
- openssl used to encrypt this
- to check if encrypted: `file archive.gzip`
- Cracking gzip encrypting is troublesome as many FPs may occur

- `for i in $(cat rockyou.txt);do openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in GZIP.gzip -k $i 2>/dev/null| tar xz;done`
	- Once this loop is finished, check the current folder for extracted docs

### Cracking .docx files
- `office2john`
### Bitlocker encrypted drives
- microsoft developed for windows
- encrypts drives and partitions
- If PIN/PASSWORD forgotten, we can use the 48-digit recovery key that was generated during the setup. It can also be brute-forced

- Using `bitlocker2john`
	- 4 different hashes will be extracted

- `bitlocker2john -i Backup.vhd > backup.hashes` - will create 4 hashes
- `grep "bitlocker\$0" backup.hashes > backup.hash` - save bitlocker hash to another file
- then `john` to crack the `backup.hash`
OR
- `hashcat -m 21000 backup.hash rockyou.txt`
