- Ticket-based authentication system
- Every service will not have a password
- If you have a ticket for service X, you will only be able to access service X and not Y

**TGT** - Ticket Granting Ticket
- first ticket obtained on the kerberos system
- Permits client to get tickets (TGS) for authorized services 
**TGS** - Ticket Granting Service
- requested by client to use a service
- allow services to verify identity and provide response

- While requesting for a TGT, client must authenticate with the domain controller
- Client sends the current timestamp encrypted with its password hash
- DC has clients password hash and if able to decrypt the timestamp, server will send the TGT to the client
- After this, client does not have to prove who they are with their password

- EG: if client wants to access the MySQL server
	- Client will request a TGS from the KDC (Key distribution center) presenting its TGT
	- KDC will then provide the TGS to access MySQL
