Before we move on, since we have root access on `dmz01` via SSH, we can run `tcpdump` as it's on the system. It can never hurt to "listen on the wire" whenever possible during a pentest and see if we can grab any cleartext credentials or generally uncover any additional information that may be useful for us. We'll typically do this during an Internal Penetration Test when we have our own physical laptop or a VM that we control inside the client's network. Some testers will run a packet capture the entire time (rarely, clients will even request this), while others will run it periodically during the first day or so to see if they can capture anything.

```shell-session
root@dmz01:/tmp# tcpdump -i ens192 -s 65535 -w ilfreight_pcap

tcpdump: listening on ens192, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes
^C2027 packets captured
2033 packets received by filter
0 packets dropped by kernel
```

- We could now transfer this down to our host and open it in `Wireshark` to see if we were able to capture anything.
