### `setuid` - Set User ID upon Execution 
- if this permission bit is set, it can allow a user to execute a program or script with the permissions of another user (privesc)
#### ID these files
- `find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null`
- eg: a stack overflow binary - we can reverse, id a vulnerability, exploit it
### `setgid` - Set Group ID 
- if this is set, we can run binaries as if we were part of the group that created them.
#### ID these files
- `find / -uid 0 -perm -6000 -type f 2>/dev/null`
- `find / -user root -perm -6000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null`

# GTFOBins
- https://gtfobins.github.io/
- eg: `apt-get`
	- `sudo apt-get update -o APT::Update::Pre-Invoke::=/bin/sh`
- It is worth familiarizing ourselves with as many GTFOBins as possible to quickly identify misconfigurations when we land on a system that we must escalate our privileges to move further.
