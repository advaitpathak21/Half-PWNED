1. Pre-Engagement: 
	- The main commitments, tasks, scope, limitations, and related agreements are documented in writing.
2. Info Gathering (RECON):
	- ID all the networks and components of the target system
3. Vulnerability Assessment:
	-  use the information found to identify potential weaknesses using scanners or manual analysis

4. Exploitation: 
	- attack performed against a system or application based on the potential vulnerability discovered during our information gathering and enumeration

5. Post-Exploitation:
	- When we attack services and gain access to the system, it is usually a user level access and not root as the services are configured in an isolated way. 
	- Escalating privileges to the ROOT user is the next step

6. Lateral Movement:
	- Move from one compromised host to another between the subnet.

7. Proof-of-Concept:
	- It is proof that a vulnerability found exists.
	- Client will reproduce our finding and confirm it
	- ![](/attachments/Pasted-image-20241115145418.png)
8. Post Engagement:
	- optimize and improve documentation and sent it to the customer after review.
	- We must also clean up all the exploits and tools left at the target so that they cant be used in the future by other attackers.
