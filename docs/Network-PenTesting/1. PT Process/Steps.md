1. Pre-engagement: Define contract and assessment details
2. Info Gathering: 
	- OSINT - info publicly available on the internet
	- Infrastructure Enum
		- using OSINT and scans to find servers (mail, name, web), cloud instances  
	- Service Enum
		- id services that allow us to interact with the server
		- find the version, information being provided, reason for the service 
	- Host Enum - find host details based on the infra we've mapped
	1. Pillaging:
		- After Exploiting (i.e. in the Post-Exploitation stage), we look for sensitive information locally
3. Vulnerability Assessment:
	- Hands on with the information and try to work on an attack vector
	- Back and forth with Info Gathering if VA not successful
	- Analysis of the target to find a vulnerability that can be exploited

4. Exploitation:
	- Prioritize the vulnerabilities that have been found based on:
		- Probability of success
		- Complexity
		- Probability of Damage

5. Post-Exploitation
	- aims to obtain sensitive and security-relevant information from a local perspective and business-relevant information
	- might require higher privileges

6. Lateral Movement:
	- If we have one compromised system in a network, we can use it as a PIVOT to penetrate deeper into the network
7. PoC
8. Post Engagement:
	- Clean up our scripts, tools, config changes (minor).
	- All our activities must be noted so cleanup is easier
	- Document what changes and what we've cleaned

HOW TO APPROACH THIS PATH:
- After 2 modules, HTB will suggest 3 retired machines + 5 active machines that we can work upon. These are single host machines

- After reading the module and getting into the machine:

- After this, we can get into Pro Labs and Endgames. These are multi-host machines.
